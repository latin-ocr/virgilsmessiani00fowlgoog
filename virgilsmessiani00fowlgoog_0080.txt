Virgil means is that the cycle of events will
recur, and that a new son oi Jupiter is to
arise-a new divine dynasty. This idea,
M. Reinach telis us, Virgil found in the
Orphic poetry and mysteries. This must be

he certainly found another idea there, which
is also prominent in the. poem - viz. that

hommes descendaient des Titans, qui avaient
tue et depece le jeune Dionysus Zagreus;
ils portaient le poids de ce crime et ne
pouvaient s'en affranchir que par l'initiation
aux mysteres.''1 As in this initiation the
worshipper partook of the nature of the
god-became in fact a young Dionysus,
so Virgii prophesies a divine nature for
his infant—Ille Deum vitam accipiet (iine
