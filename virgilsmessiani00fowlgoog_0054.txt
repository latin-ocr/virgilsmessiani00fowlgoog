anticipation of a spiritual Messiah, when
Virgil declares that Augustus is the deliverer
he celebrates, that Augustus’ work is to bring
the great reformationi If Virgil was in the
end content to accept as the Deliverer a
personality so full of blots‚ can we interpret
seriously his loftier predictionsl But such a
criticism is based on a misconception. Virgil
was not content with the past or present
wealrnesses of the particular human being
called Octaviam he condemns roundly, as
we have seen, the violent deeds linked with
his earlier career; what Virgil extols is the
vast service1 which Augustus was visibly
rendering to mankind, and the still higher
service which scemed to lie in the new ideal
of the Empire. In the passage devoted to
Augustus in Aeneid vi., there is no mention
of his triumphs in war3 his first glory is
the recall of the Golden Age of Justice ;2

¹ This conception oi service to humanity marks all the
praise os Augustus in Virgil, as I have shown elsewhere
(in the Proceedings of the Classical Association lor 1906),
and separates it somewhat widely from the tributes of
Propertius, Tibullus, and even of Horace ; and by a great
gullsrom the abominable fiatteries os Domitian in Martial.
