cry, My father and my mother, the riches
of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
shall be carried away ’' (viii. 4). Indeed
Virgil himself repeats the latter words 'in
the line

Incipe parve puer risu cognoscere matrem.

We go on now to consider the other details
of the new age depicted by Virgil, and, if
possible, to find out where they are taken
from. It is not necessary to fix on some
one authority to the exclusion of all others,
nor need we expect to find perfect consistency.
Virgil is a poet, writing at the most critical
epoch of human history, with a heart and
mind open to all influences; and in this
poem he embodies the half-consciens hopes
and forebodings of his time. The Sibyl
was never supposed to be logical, and Virgil
here makes no attempt to reconcile the rival
claims of Apelle, Saturn and Jupiter, who
are all named as presiding over the new
age.
