matri longa decern tulerunt fastidia menses.
Incipe, parue puer: cui non risere parentes,
nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est.

Nota-Cui non nitere parentes. In spite of Mr
Warde F owler's weighty plea (p. 71) for Quintilian's

balance of authority, in the MSS, in Servius and
Nonius, is on the side of the traditional text3
and I prefer its hunc even to Dr Postgate's hinc.
Quintilian took his reading to mean “Si quis infans
parentibus non adridet.'' But is it not less difficult
to believe in the accidental corruption ol C to Q
in Quintilian's copy, than to ascribe to Virgil‚ in the
climax of such a poem, three such bewildering
lapses into everyday diction as (ι) the transitive
use ol nilare5 (2) the meaning “ smile upon '' instead
oi “ deride '' 3 and (3) the change (on which Quintilian
comments) from the plural qui to the singular hunc?
Such solecisms as (2) and (3) occur, of course, in
conversation and careless writing, as Quintilian and
Scaliger knev 3 but 1 am not yet persuaded to find
them iu Virgrl.

The conjecture qui non risere parenti removes
only one of the difficulties and supposes a larger
corruption in Quintilian than the MS. reading of
our passage implies in Quintilian's text of Virgil.

The translation I have adopted gives the essential
