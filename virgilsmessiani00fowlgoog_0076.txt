1 now turn to a very different and far more
eccentric explanation ς one which is extremely
interesting and incidentally useful, but hardly,
lthink, the work of a manos strong poetic
feeling or thorough knowledge of Virgil. M.
Reinach1emphatically denies that the poern
contains any kind of historical allusion, or
stands in any sort of relation to the events
of Virgil’s age. “ Je me propose,” he writeS,²
“d’etablir qu'il n'y a pas d’allusions histori-
ques ou politiques dans la IV Eglogue, qu’il
n'y est question ni du fils de Pollion, ni
du fils d’aucun autre personnage du tempS,
enfin que la caractere du poeme tout entier
est exclusivement religieux ou mystique.”
He adds, with some force, that if Virgil had
not addressed the poem to Pollio, and placed
the birth of the child in Pollio’s consulship,

such conditions.” Ι am sorry to differ from an old
friend, lor whom I have the profoundest respect; Ι can
only say that l would ask him to re-consider the poem
in the light os the last four lines. Ι look on it as
the celebration, in mystical, and as the writers of
these Essays believe, Messianic language, of the actual
birth oi a real child, who is destined to initiate a new
era os happiness for Italy and the world.
