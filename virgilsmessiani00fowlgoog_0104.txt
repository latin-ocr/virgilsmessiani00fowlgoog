nr Josaerr Β. Meron .

THE editors of Virgil seem content for the
most part to regard this poem as merely a
hyperbolical expression of the hope that the

agreement made at Brundisium between
⁴ Antony and Octavius in the year 40 ac.

might put an end to the civil strife from which
Rome had so long suffered. The few who
have made any attempt to account for the
special features of the new era foretold by
the poet have usually assumed without proof
that these features were capable oi explanation
out ol the commonplaces of Greek or Roman
literature, there being, in their opinion,
nothing to justify Merivale’s assertion1 that

“the glowing language in which the reign
of happiness is depicted appropriates almost
every image, and breathes some portion of
the spirit, of the Messianic predictions.”
