THE LAST LlNE 77

often no names, or only acquired them in
the course of time by strange processeS‚
only too common in a land where both
the form and the terminology of religion
became a curious concrete ol Greek, Etruscan,
Sabine, and Latin elements. Now Juno and

to find that in his note on Catullus quoted already,
Scaliger, with the habitual acuteness which he added to

cubilis. Qui, inquit, non risere ad parentes nec Genius
illum accipit mensa nec Dea hanc cubili. But Scaliger
did not know the Danielian Servius’ comment, or he
would have quoted it; nor did he know Hercules=

Genius: hence he thinks ol Genius apparently only as
the numen os the festive board.
