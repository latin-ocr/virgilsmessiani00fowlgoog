HERACLITUS ΟΝ THE SIBYL 93

in a different light in the famous
saying of the great Ephesian philosopher,
HeraclituS, towards the end of the sixth
century (tle. about the time of the expulsion
of the Roman kings). ln Fragment xii. of
Bywater’s edition we read the striking words

-Σίβυλλα δὲ μαινομένῳ στόματι ἀγέλαστα καὶ

ἀκαλλώπιστα καὶ ἀμύριστα φθεγγομένη χιλίων
ε’τέων ἐξικνέεται τῇ φωνῇ διὰ τὸν θεόν, “the
Sibyl with frenzied lips uttering things un·
mirthful, unadorned and unperfumed, reaches
by her voice through a thousand years by
the will of the god.”l Plato gives an equally
lolty idea of the Sibyl in the Phaedrus,
p. 244, where, after speaking of the many
benefits public and private bestowed on man
through the divine madness ol the prophetess
at Delphi and the priestess at Dodona, he

lThe genitive is used with ἐξικνεῖσθαι by Xenophon,
Anah, iii. 3, 7, ol ἀκοντισταὶ βραχύτερα ἠκόντιζον ἡ dn
ἐξικνεῖσθαι τῶν σφενδονητῶν, “the range of the Javelins was
too short to reach the slingers.” In other passages the
word is better translated “to hit,'’ “to cover.'’ The
meaning ol Heraclitus would thus be “covers with her
voice a thousand years,'' tle. utters truth bearing on far
distant ages. We may conjecture, however, from Ovid's
“Cumaeos annos ’' quoted above, as well as from other
references, that some understood them as attributing long
life to the Sibyl herself, “attains a thousand years.''
