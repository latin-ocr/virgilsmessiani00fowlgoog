VIRGIL'S FOURTH ECLOGUE
w1TH A VERSE TRAwsLAwoN

THE following rendering is mainly the work os Professor

Conway, but he is deeply indebted to the criticisms and
suggestions of his colleegues, and even more to his
former pupil, Miss F. E. Bevan, Headmistress of the

South Liverpool School for Girls, who generously put
into his hands a draft version in the same metre, from
which were taken l. 26, most os ll. 75-79, and not a
few other words and phrases, especially in the ChildÎ‡
hood passage.
