on through a thousand yearS,'' for Ovid
records the complaint ol the Sibyl who has
still to live three hundred years out of the
destined thousand, during which she will con·
tinually dwindle away till nothing remains
but a voice (Met. xiv. ¹43)-

Voce tamen noscat, vocem mihi iata relinquent.

virgil, on the other hand, states that the
oracles were usually written down on leaves‚¹
which were liable to be scattered in disorder
by the wind when the door ol the cave was
opened‚ and which, when once scattered, the
Sibyl took no pains to rearrange. Hence
those who apply to her for advice-

Inconsulti abeunt sedemque odere Sibyllae.

For this reason Helenus warns AEneas to
implore ὼε prophetess to utter the oracles
with her lips, instead ol writing thern down

(Aen. iii. 448-457). The disordered leaves
were no doubt intended to signily the inco·

herenee and the sudden transitions of the
oracular books.

Α Far different from this is what Livy tells us
of the Libri Fatales. lt is of course possible
