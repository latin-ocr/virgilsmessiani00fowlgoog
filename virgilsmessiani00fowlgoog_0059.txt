42 THE Musslnrvlc mun IN VIRGIL

And in the same vision of Anchises we
have the famous description of the duty to
which Rome is called :¹-

“Others l well believe with finer touch
Shall kindle breath in forms of bronze, and carve
Faces ol marble all aglow with life ;
Others shall plead with greater eloquente,
Make chart of Heaven and tell the rising stars ;
But choose thou, son of Rome, the imperial task
Of ruling peoples ; this shall be thy art,
Show mercy to the humble, crush the proud,
And make the nations learn the law of peace.”

But the fullest embodiment of this con-
ception is in the second half of the Aeneid.

The story gives us a dramatic picture of
the ideal ruler in conflict with the concrete

forces of selfi'shnesS, passion, and ignor-

suggests turning a wilderness into a garden; artes, which
includes philosophie, artistic, and poetic creation as well
as mechanical inventions: and atterendo, which includes
every form of service rendered to one’s lellovs 3 nor can
the golden simplicity of the whole passage be conveyed
by any translation.
¹ Aen. vi. 847-853.

Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera,-

Credo equidem-uiuos ducent de marmore uoltus:

Orabunt causas melius, caelique meatus

Describent radio et surgentia sidera dicent:

Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento ;

Hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem

Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos
