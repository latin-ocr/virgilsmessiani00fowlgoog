This strong Virgilian evidence, which led
my old teacher and friend, Henry Nettleship‚
to adopt the view that the child was the one

line 500; Georg. ii. 170 fol.; Aen. i. 257fol, vi. 788 fol,
viii. 678 and 714 fol. The most striking of these is of

expressed above has been stated with great force by
