Once more then these last four lines,
applied as a touchstone to the interpretation
of the poem as a whole, put us instantly on
our guard, and save us from extravagances.
They seem to bring us back to Virgil‚ to
Italy, and to common sense3 and no one
has a right to deal with the Eclogue who will
not give them their due place in it. But they
