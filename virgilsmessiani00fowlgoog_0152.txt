which constitutes the second volume of his
first edition of the Oracula,· and next to that,
Klausen’s AEneas und die Penaten, pp. ²03·
3125 Marquardt's Romische Staatsverwaltung,
vol. iii. pp. 42·54 and 336-3443 Schiirer's
Hz'story of tlte Jewish People, div. ii. vol. iii.
pp. 27o·292, containing a full ὶ)ἱ1)1ἰοςτειρῑιγ;Δ
and Bouchd·Leclercq, Histoire de la Divina-
tion, vol. ii. 93·199· See, too, Hastings’
D. os B. vol. v. p. 66 foll. under “Sibylline
Oracles.” It may be worth while to com-
pare the old edition of the Sibylline Books

Ulixes, Φερρέφαττα Περσεφόνη and Proserpina. And it
must be remembered that a Sybil or witch is wont to
