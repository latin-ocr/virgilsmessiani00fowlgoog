Aratus,1 Ονίᾱ,2 all start with this, descending
to their own generation by a gradual decline
from golden to silver, from silver to brazen,
from brazen to iron, except that Hesiod
interpolatos an age of Heroes between the
brazen and the iron. Still more plainly is
this principle of degeneration expressed by
Horace (Carm. iii. 6. 45)—

Damnosa quid non imminuit diesi
Aetas pareutum peior avis tulit
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem ;

and by Juvenal (xiii. 28)-

Nona aetas oritur peioraque saecula ferri
Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa
Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo.

But, it may be asked, may not this imagina-
tion ol a golden age in the future be derived
from the Stoic doctrine of the periodic renewal
of the world, a παλιγγενεσία or ἀποκατάστασις3

—“ better any age than this.'’ Paley even holds that
vv. 180-201 are descriptive os a sixth and still more
degenerate age.

¹ Phaenomena, 110 loll. Aratus omits the iron age.

⁸ Metam. i. 89 soll.

⁸ For these words compare Varro ap. Aug. Civ. Dei.
xxii. 28, Sext. Emp. adv. Math. v. 105, Anton. xi. 1.
Both terms were borrowed by Christian writers, see
Acts iii. 21, Matt. xix. 28.
