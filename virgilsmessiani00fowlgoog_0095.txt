that we have in these lines nothing more than
an allusion, in the true Virgilian manner, to
an old Roman or Italian practice, still at that
time preserved in some aristocratic families,
though already no doubt bereft of its original
significance‚ and by no means clear to the

mind of Virgil himself 31 an allusion quite in
keeping with the picture that the poet brings
before us in these tendet lines: The child that
will not smila on tis mother is not worthy of
notice from the deities presiding over bis parents
unz'on-that is all. And we may now thus
paraphrase the whole passage: “ Begin,
little one, to recognise thy mother with a
smile: she deserves it of thee, for her travail
hasbeen long: begin, little one, for babes
who do not thus own their mothers’ love,
cannot expect the favour of her guardian
deities.”

The passage thus explained, 1 can hardly
believe that any one will still contend that the

¹ By Virgil's time, still more in that of Servius, the
custom and its meaning may have been imperiectly
understood, only surviving in the “nurse’s saw,” as
Mr Seaton calls it. It is impossible lor us to recover
them exactly, and unwise to press the words of poet
or commentator too closely. But as to the demand dea

there should be no doubt.
