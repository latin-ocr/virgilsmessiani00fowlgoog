SPURIOUS ORACLES 101

in libris, in quem hominem et in quod
tempus esti Callide enim qui illa composuit
perfecit, ut quodcunque accidisset praedictum

Suetonius (lul. Caesar, 79): “Fama per-

quindecimvirum, sententiam dicturum, ut,
quoniam libris fatalibus contineretur Parthos
nisi a rege non posse vinci, Caesar rex
appellaretur.”

One method of distinguishing between
true and false prophecies appears to have
been the use of acrostics in the latter. Thus
Cicero (De Dio. ii. 111) argues that such an
artificial form of composition is inconsistent
with the divine frenzy ascribed to the Sibyl,
and, Varro is quoted to the same effect by
Dion. Hal. (Α. R. iv. 62), as saying that
the spurious oracles may be detected hythe
socalled acrostics.1

written about 50 uc. (see Teuffel's Rom. Lit. rat. 2), and
