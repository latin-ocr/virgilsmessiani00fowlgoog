picture of the four world-ages, possibly also
by Jewish pictores of the Millennium, which
was to be followed by a fresh outbreak ol
the powers ol evil; or it may merely reflect
the sudden transitions from good to evil in
the visions of Isaiah and the other propheto.
The interruption to the triumph of good is
in any case merely a passing phenomenon,
whether we are intended to see in it the
last struggle of evil, or a necessary part oi
the training ol the Conqueror¹ for the high
office to which he is appointed by

Concordes stabili latomm numine Parcae,

a line which reads like a protest on the part

ol the poet against the sad never-ending
round of which the Stoics dreamt.

11. 50-52. “ Aspice, venturo laetantur ut muriz
saeclo,’' cf. Ecl. v. 61 foll. A not unworthy
echo of such passages as lsaiah xliv. 23,
“Sing, Ο ye heavens, for the Lord hath
done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth:
break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
forest and every tree therein: for the Lord
hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify Him-
self in Israel ”3 see also xlix. 13, lii. 9, lv. 12.
