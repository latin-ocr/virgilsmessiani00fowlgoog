36 THE MESSIANIC IDEA IN VIRGIL

Georgic. Hardly even Cicero, and certainly
no other man of that generatim, felt the
shame of that corruption as did Virgil. With
burning scorn he points to the roads by which
the greatest men1 of his age had won their
way to power.

“Some fret with labouring oars the treacherous sea
Eager to trade in slaughter, breaking through
The pomp and sentinels of ancient kings.

This man will storm a town and sack its homes,

To drink from alabaster, sleep in purple.

His rival hoards up gold and broods alone

On buried treasure. Thm man’s dream is set

On power to sway a crowd by eloquence,

Or so command the acclaim ol high and low

That vast assemblies at his coming vie

To fill his ears with plaudits. Here the victors

March proud of brothers’ blood upon their hands ;

There steal the vanquished, torn from horne and
children,

To seek new fatherlands in alien skies.”

And in the Arneai, who can forget the
picture of the fall of Troy, with the con-

centrated pathos of its central scene, the

² G. ii. 503· 512. Every Roman reader must· have felt
the indictment which these lines iramed against the
first triumvirs, though not against them only: the
oriental triumphs ol Pompey with his enormous force:
the cruelty ol Caesars Gallie Wars (especially, perhaps,
the siege of Alesia); and the miser's wealth ol their
partner Crassus may well have been in the poet's mind.
