ment in the latest oracle from the East,² that
the conqueror ol Croesus was also the destined

But how are we to account for the use

βουλή autem est sententiat ergo Σιβόλλας

quasi σίου (θεοῦ) βουλάς dixerunt ”3 see
Alexandra (pp. 1, 2), where this etymology

for Italian, than sor Hellenic lips. On the other hand,
foreign names suffer many things which are grievous
to the student os the regular phonetic changes of any
one language. No one can yet say precisely where or
when it was that Πολυδεύκης becanm Pollux, Ὀδυσσεύι
