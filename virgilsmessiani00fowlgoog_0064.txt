“stretch out his hands in longing for the
further shore,” nowhere more touchingly
express his sense of the incompleteness
of the greatest human triumph, than by
this last line of the Aeneid, his last word to
mankind. His hero has· fought, has suffered
long, has conquered, yet his conquest itself
is cause for sorrow, because it shows that
the deeper enemy, the wilfulness of human ·
passion, has yet to be destroyed. Surely,
if more than human breath ever moved in
human utterance, some whisper at least of
divine inspiration must be heard in such an
ending to such a poem as this. In Dante's
words we think of Virgil as of “one who

per umbras. The Homeric warrior dies “ moaning over
his own late,” but not “indignant” Only Virgil has
room sor this touch. Observe that the ethical colour

of the word is even stronger in Latin than in English
because of its close association with dagnus and dignari.
