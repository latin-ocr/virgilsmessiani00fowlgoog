At last, when stronger years have made thee
man
The voyager will cease to vex the sea
Nor ships ol pinevood longer serve in traffic,
For every fruit shall grow in every land

40 The field shall thrive unharrowed, vines unpruned, 55
And stalwart ploughmen leave their oxea free.

Wool shall not learn the dyer’s coaening art,
But in the meadow, on the ram’s own back,
Nature shall give new colours to the fleece,

Soit blushing glow ol crimson, gold of crocus, 60
45 And lambs be clothed in scarlet as they feed.

‘⁴ Run, run, ye spindlesl On to this lulfilment

Speed the world's fortune, draw the living thread.'’

So heaven's unshalren ordinance declaring
The Sister Fates enthrorred together sang. 65

Come theu, dear child of gods, Jove’s mighty heir,
Begin thy high career ; the hour is sounding.
50 See how it shakes the vaulted firmament,
Earth and the spreading seas and depth ol sky l
See, ia the davning of a new creation yo
The heart of all things living throbs with joyl
Oh, il but lile would bring me days enough
55 And breath not all too scant to sing thy deeds,
Not Thracian Orpheus should outdo the strain,
Nor Linus, though his mother aid the one, 7 5
His sire the other, sweet Calliope
And beautiful Apollo, Lord of Song.
Nay, even Pan, his own Arcadia judging,
Should, hy Arcadia's judgment, own deleat.
