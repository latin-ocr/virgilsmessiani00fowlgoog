72 THE CHILD OF THE 1²0th

passage of Catullusl to which all editors
refer or should refer us:

Torquatus, volo, parvulus
Matris e gremio suae
Porrigens teneras manus
Dulce rideat ad patrem
Semihiante labello.

I believe that Quintilian correctly copied his
MS„ which had qui non risere parentes, and that
the qui became cuiin later copies through a mis·
understanding of the sense and the grammar,
from which Quintilian, who makes' it perfectly
clear that he understood the plural quito be
followed grammatically by the singular hunc

in the next Ιίηε,2 was saved by his good taste
and poetical feeling. Further‚ 1 believe that
Virgil really wrote “qui non risere parentes ”
- not parenti -and I take parentes as the
object ol risere, understanding it as sorne-
what colloquial Latin, as in PlautuS, Captivi

¹ Catull. lxi. 216 fol.

²“ Ex illis enirn ‘qui non riserel hic, quern non
dignata.'' 1 cannot lollow Dr Postgate in his account
ol these words (Class. Rern, Feb. 1902), nor in bis
suggestion ol hinc lor hunc. Quintilian had just written
Est figura et in numero, vel cum singulan' pluralis
subjungitur. But Dr Postgate contends that Quintiliau’s
copy ol Virgil was a bad one.
