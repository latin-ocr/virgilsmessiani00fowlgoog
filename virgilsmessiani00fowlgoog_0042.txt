the Sibyl had spoken of Christ (even by
repeating “ prophecies that had been heard '’)
had not Virgil referred to her in this Ecloguc‚
-for the reference ol the Eclogue to Christ
was to his mind too patent to admit of any
reasonable doubt. So it came about that the
Dies irae (whatever its date) ranks the Sibyl
side by side with David.

Such, too, was the belief of the poet Dante.
Every one is familiar with the unique position
of honour which Virgil holds in the Dz‘vina
Commedia as the interpreter of the Divine will
and the poet's guide through two-thirds of
the unseen world. Nor is this due merely
to reverence for Virgil as a poet. Explicitly
and many times Dante ascribes to him the
power of converting men to a knowlege of

divine truth.² At the outset‚ when Dante

facile crederem, nisi quod poetarum quidam in Romana
lingua nobilissimus antequam diceret ea de innouatione
saeculi quae in Domini nostri Jesu Christi regnum satis

‘ concinere et conuenire uideantur, praeposuit uersum,

dicens, Ultima Cumaei iam carminis aetas!² Augustine's
wording has the caution oi a true scholar.

to Christianity,1 cannot do better than refer the reader
to the very interesting and scholarly Excursus (to which
