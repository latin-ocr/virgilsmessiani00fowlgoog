FORBIGER’S OBJECTION ANSWERED 107

in her story he dared to reverse the old ideas
ol Roman andos Punic saith, why should we
suppose him to be less sensitive than was
Longinus afterwards1 to the sublimity of
the sacred books of the Hebrews? BesideS,
we have plenty of evidence to show that, in
this time of the breaking up ol old faiths,
more than one Eastern religion exercised an
extraordinary attraction in Rome.

If we suppose, then, that such a vision
as we have in the eleventh chapter of Isaiah
had been made the subject of a Sibylline
poem, are there any allusions in the Fourth
Eclogue which would correspond with and

might be explained by this?

We will take first the general idea of a
golden age still to come. So faras Greeks
or Romans in general knew or dreamt of
a golden age, it belonged to the infancy
of the world, corresponding to the Garden
of Eden among the Hebrews. Hesiod,²

1 De Sublim. ix. 9.

2Ορενα, 109.-Goettliug thinks that Hesiod looked
sorward to an improvement aiter the iron age, because he
utters the wish that he might either have died before it,
or been born afterwards ; but there is nothing to support
such an interpretation, and it is better to take the words
as Paley does, as merely expressive of strong dislike
