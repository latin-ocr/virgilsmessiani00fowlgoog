TRANSLATION

Muses to whom Sicilian shepherds sang,
Teach me a lostier strain. The hazel eopse
And lowly tamarisk will not always please.
If still the wild, free woodland note be heard,
Our woodland song must suit a consul's ear. 5

Lo, the last age of Cumae's seer has come l
Again the great millennial aeon dawns.
Once more the hallowed Maid appears, once more
Kind Saturn reigns, and from high heaven descends
The firstborn child¹ of promise. Do but thou, 10
Pure Goddess, by whose grace on infant eyes
Daylight first breaks, smile softly on this babe ;
The age of iron in his time shall cease
And golden generations fill the world.
E'en now thy brother, Lord ol Light and Heahng, 15
Apollo, rules and ends the older day.

Thy office, Pollio, thine, shall mark the year
Wherein this star begins his glorious course.
Under thy banner all the stains of ill, =
'l’hat shame us yet, shall melt away and break 20
The long, long night of universal dread.
15 For the child's birthright is the life of gods,
Heroes and gods together he shall know,
And rule a world his sire has blessed with peace.

‘sl—Vaua progenies denotes the expected child who is
to be the first of the new and better generation.
