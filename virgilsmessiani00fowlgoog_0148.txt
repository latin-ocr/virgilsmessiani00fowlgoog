Plato.

It may help to explain this high apprecia-
tion‚ if we call to mind the words of Simmias
in the Pbaedo (p. 85 d), where, discussing the
question of the immortality of the soul‚ he
says it is man’s duty to find the best and
most irrefragable os human wordS, and trust-
ing himself to this, as to a raft, to set forth
on the hazardous voyage of life, unless it were
possible to find a surer and less dangerous
way on board a stronger vessel‚ some word
of God (εἰ μή τις δύναιτο ἀσφαλέστερον καὶ
ἀκινδυνότερον ἐπὶ βεβαιοτέρου ὀχήματος, λόγου
θείου τινός, διαπορευθῆναι). SO, at a later
period, Porphyry justified the publication of
his treatise on the “Philosophy to be derived
from Oracles,” on the ground that the use
ol such a collection ol the divine responses
would be understood by all who had felt the
painful craving after truth, and had some-
times wished that, by receiving the mani·
festation of it from the gods, they might be
relieved from their doubts by information
not to be disputed (ὅσοι περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν
ὠδίναντες ηὔξαντό ποτε τῆς ἐκ θεῶν ἐπιφανείας
