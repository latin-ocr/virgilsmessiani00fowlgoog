the terrible punishments in store for un-
believers. The bitterness engenderod by
persecution solaced itself by imaginations of
the still heavier woes stored up by righteous
vengeance lor the persecutors. This, 1 think,
will account for the prevailing tone both of
the Sibylline passages cited by the FatherS,
and oi the body of Sibylline writings which
have come down to us, though the parallels
which l have quoted above show that the
future happiness in store lor the righteous was
not left entirely unnoticed. l think, however,
that a careful examination ol Virgil’s Eclogue
suggests that he must have had before him,
if not an actual translation from lsaiah, at
least some closer paraphrase of Messianic
prophecy than we now possess.

Another interesting question is how Hera·
clitus could have spoken so highly of the
Sibylline Oracles of his time. Judging from
the parodies in Aristophanes‚1 as well as
from what are regarded as the most ancient
of the extant oracleS, we should hardly have

¹ Aristoph. Eq. 61 : ἂδει δὲ χρησμούς· ὁ δὲ γέρων σιβυλλίᾳ.
The oracles given in ll. 1015, 1030, 1037, etc, are

generally ascribed to Bacis, but we may suppose them
to represent the Sibylline type. Compare also Pax 1095.

See Alexandre, p.'14o soll.
