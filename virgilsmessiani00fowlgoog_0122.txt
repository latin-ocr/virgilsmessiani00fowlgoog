probable that this carmen was ol Jewish
origin. No other people had >such strong
reasons for composing such oracles; no
others could make them so interesting; no
others had such opportunities ol pushing
the sale of them as the ubiquitous JeW. We
may even indulge the fancy that the interest
which Virgil had shown in the Sibylline
poems may have led to his being consulted
by Augustus and Maecenas in the selection
of Oracles for the Palatine temple, which
was dedicated in 27 rac. It is true that
Augustus did not succeed to the office of
Pontifex Maximus till the death of Lepidus

in 12 Bc, seven years after the death of
Virgil‚ but he had taken a leading part in
the restoration of the national religion ever

young days. Roman soldiers were in Egypt lor several
years before Caesar went there. We read oi Gabiniani
milites in Alexandria (Caes. Bell. Ciu. iii. 4). Moreover‚
Caesars soldiers were chiefly from Virgil's own country,
Cisalpine Gaul, and they were with him in Alexandria ior
many months. Then Cleopatra and her suite came to
Rome and stayed some time. Thus there was much con·
nexion between Italy and Alexandria 3 and we probably
underrate the facility with which such things as prophetie
verses might get about among the learned and pseudo·
learned alike. Further, the idea oi the golden age was
more likely to be to the iront in Virgil's time thau in
76 ss.c.‚ or at any rate more likely to attract attention.”
