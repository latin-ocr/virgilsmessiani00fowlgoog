Latin word for “child ’' is one that is
masculine in form, namely pum· and hence
‚it is natural, indeed almost inevitable, that
the poet should write as ii it were certain
that the child would be a boy. And it is
well to notice now that the lines which
invoke Lucina, the Goddess of Birth, 3ηά
the concluding prayer that the mother's
weary months of waiting may be happily
ended, make it quite certain (to every reader,
at least, whose sense of humour is not some·
what in abeyance) that it is not oi some
mystical moral emblem, but of an actual

mother and child, that we are meant to think.
One of the sacred books of the Roman

state-religion was a selection oi rhymes
3ηά rubrics attributed to an ancient Wise

sight, but Marie Ferre, or whatever her name was, took
him for granted, sex and all—'³

To Virgil it would have seemed a discourtesy to the
parents, 3ηά more an ill omen, to speak as if there
was any doubt os the sex of the child to be; and it
was clearly essential to the whole scheme of a poem
which linked a great reformation ol humanity to the
personality oi the child, that the poet should “take ior
granted‚” the sex of his Prince oi peace.

1 cannot help hoping that these consideratione may
do something to modify Prof. Ramsay's strange but re·
iterated belief (see p. 58) that “a poet could not work
under such conditions,” i.e.‚ before the child was born.
