For thee, fair Child, the lavish Earth shall
spread 2 5
Τὴγ earliest playthings‚ trailing ivy-wreaths
And loxgloves red and cups of water-filies,
20 And wild acanthus leaveswith sunshine stored.
The goats shall come uncalled, weighed down with
milk,
Nor lions' roar affrlght the labouring kine.
Thy very cradle, blossoming for joy,
Shall with soft buds caress thy baby face;
The treacherous snake and deadly herb shall
die,
a 5 And Syrian spikenard blow on every bank.

But when thy boyish eyes begin to read 35
Rome's ancient provess and thy sire’s great story,
Gaining the power to know what manhood is,

Then, league by league‚ the plain without a
sower

Shall ripen into waves of yellow corn3

On every wild-thorn purple grapes shall cluster, 40

And stubborn oaks yield honey clear as dev.

But in u'ren's hearts some lingering seed of ill

E’en yet shall bid them launch adventurous keels‚

And brave the inviolate sea, and wall their towns,

And'cut earth's face with furrows. Then behold 45

Another Tiphys take the belm and steer

Another Argo, manned by chosen souls

Seeking the golden, undiscovered East.

35 New wars shall rise, and Troy renewed shall see
Another great Achilles leap to land. 50
