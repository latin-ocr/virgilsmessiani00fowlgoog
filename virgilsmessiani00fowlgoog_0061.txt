44 THE Musstnmc IDEA IN VIRGIL

as an invader, but as a friend3 no freebooter,
but a pilgrim, secking only to execute divine
commands. The war is created by the powers
of evil.

“Mischiel, thou art afoot3 take thou what course
thou wilt,”

cries Shakspere's Antony, as the mob he
has excited rush off to murder the innocent
Cinna. It is the same cruel, unscrupulous
passion which Virgil portrays when Juno1
sends the Fury to incite the Latins to break
faith with AEneas. Mark her commission.

“ Thine is the power to embroil kind brothers’ hands,
Sink homes in hatred, light the father’s pyro,
And make his treeborn children dread the lash.
A thousand names, a thousand mischiess thou l
Wake all thy cunning: break their solemn treaty,
Sow slanderous seed that blood may be the harvest,
And fill at once hearts, voices, hands with war.''

To this spirit the brave, patient humanity
of AEneas is in perpetual contrast. ln words

¹ Aen. vii. 335·340.
Tu potes unanimos armare in proelia fratres,

· Atque odiis uersare domos, tu uerbera tectis
Funereasque inferre faces. Tibi nomina mille,
Mille nocendi artes: secundum concute pectus,
Disiice compositam pacem, sere crimina belli ;
Anna uelit poscatque simul rapiatque iuventus.
