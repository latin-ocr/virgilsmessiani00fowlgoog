DANTE, POPE‚ JOHNSON 27

Parnassus. . . . and next didst light me on
the road to God. Thou didst as one who
goes by night, who bears a light behind
him and helps not himself, but after him
makes the people wiso, when thou saidst‚
‘The world renews itself ε justice returns
and the first age of man 3 and a new offspring
descends frorn Heaven.' Through thee Ι
was a poet, through thee a Christian. . . .
Already was the whole world teeming with
the true belief, sown by the messages of
the eternal reahn: and thy word . . ..was
in harmony with the new preachers‚ wherefore
Ι began to visit thern. And at last they
carne to seem to me so holy that when
Domitian persecuted them, their plaints
were not without tears from me. And so
long as [Ι was] in the world Ι aided thern,
and their righteous manners made me hold
all other philosophies of small price. . . .
Thou then . . . . didst lift the covering that
hid from me so much good.‘'

In our own country it is scarcely two
hundred years1 since Pope published his
Messian, in the preface to which he accepts
the view of Augustino, namely, that the

¹ 1709 is the date of the Pastorals.
